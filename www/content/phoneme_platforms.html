phoneME Feature is an open source development effort addressing the technical needs of devices in the feature phone segment of the market. CLDC and MIDP are the most widely adopted Java ME portable application platforms used in devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, TV set-top boxes, and other embedded devices. In fact, eight out of every 10 mobile handsets include implementations using technologies combined with supplemental Java ME technologies, enabling Java technology applications and content to leverage newer and more advanced capabilities within devices.

<h3><A NAME="phonemeadvanced">phoneME Advanced Platform</A></h3>
<p>
phoneME Advanced is an open source development effort addressing the technical needs of devices in the advanced phone segment of the market. Advanced mobile handsets have established a firm and rapidly growing position in the mobile handset market. These devices often include powerful operating systems and hardware architectures that provide numerous opportunities for technical innovation and differentiation. To properly utilize these capabilities, mobile handset OEMs are looking towards CDC. The CDC architecture is well suited to leverage key high-level OS features such as memory management, process structure, linking, multi-tasking, and more. In addition to providing enhanced compatibility to and from implementations of Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE platform) technologies, the architecture is highly portable and reduces the integration effort associated with a variety of application environments and middleware components.
