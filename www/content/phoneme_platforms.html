<p>
 phoneME Feature project is an open source development effort addressing the market and technical requirements of &#8220;feature phone&#8221; devices.   The majority (about 80%) of mobile phones in the world today are feature phones.  Devices of this type typically include a high-resolution screen, multiple forms of messaging (SMS, MMS, IM, Email), basic 2D and 3D gaming, a camera, music player, Internet browser, etc.  
<P>
Powering all this functionality is a core set of Java ME technologies known as CLDC (the Java VM) and MIDP(the mobile information device profile).   CLDC and MIDP are the most widely adopted Java ME application platforms used in mobile phones today.  Layered on this base is a set of additional Java ME technologies often called &#8220;optional packages&#8221; that come in the form of JSRs (Java Specification Requests).  
  <P> The phoneME Feature software includes the latest milestone & in-development 
        implementations of CLDC and MIDP as well as implementations for a number 
        of optional package JSRs.

          <h3><A NAME="phonemeadvanced">phoneME Advanced Project</A></h3>
          <p> phoneME Advanced project is a development effort to enable an open source 
            implementation addressing the technical needs of devices in the advanced 
            phone segment of the market. Advanced mobile handsets have established 
            a firm and rapidly growing position in the mobile handset landscape. 
            These devices often include powerful operating systems and hardware 
            architectures that provide numerous opportunities for technical innovation 
            and differentiation. To properly utilize these capabilities mobile 
            handset OEMs are looking towards CDC. The CDC architecture is well 
            suited to leverage key high-level OS features such as memory management, 
            process structure, linking, multi-tasking, etc. In addition to providing 
            enhanced compatibility to and from implementations of Java SE, the 
            architecture is highly portable and reduces the integration effort 
            associated with a variety of application environments and middleware 
            components.
