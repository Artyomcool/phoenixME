<h2><a name="ref1" id="ref1">Q: Can I make changes to phoneME source code? </a></h2>
    <p> A: We encourage you to contribute source code to the phoneME project. 
      In accordance with the phoneME project governance process, you can submit 
      code to the project leader either as a user, a developer, or as a committer. 
      If your code is accepted to be integrated into the source tree, then you 
      will be asked to sign a Contributor's Agreement similar to what Apache Software 
      Foundation requires. <STRONG>For more information</STRONG> on the governance 
      process and the various roles for members in the community, please review 
      <a href="https://mobileandembedded.dev.java.net/governance.html">Mobile

<h2><a name="cldc1" id="cldc1">Q: What is phoneME Feature? </a></h2>
    <p> A: phoneME Feature is an open source development effort addressing the 
      market and technical requirements of mainstream mobile devices (“feature 
      phones”). The phoneME Feature software includes Java ME Connected Limited 
      Device Configuration (CLDC), Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), as 
      well as a number of optional package JSRs that incorporate a variety of 
      key wireless industry standards and capabilities.

<h2><a name="cldc2" id="cldc2">Q: What is phoneME Feature MR1?</a></h2>
    <p> A: phoneME Feature MR1 represents the first milestone release of phoneME 
      Feature software in open source.

<h2><a name="cldc3" id="cldc3">Q: What about phoneME Feature MR2?</a></h2>
    <p> A: phoneME Feature MR2 software is expected to be released to the community 
      as an active project by the end of this year, 2006. This release includes 
      many new JSRs as outlined on the <a href="https://phoneme.dev.java.net/content/phoneme_feature_r2.html">phoneME 
      MR2 page</a> and we look forward to active community participation as this 
      development effort proceeds.

<h2><a name="cldc4" id="cldc4">Q: On what platforms is phoneME Feature MR1 software 
      available?</a></h2>
    <p> A: phoneME Feature MR1 software currently supports deployment on Linux/ARM, 
      Linux/x86, and Win32/x86 -based devices. For a list of currently supported 
      target hardware and software platforms, see the phoneME Feature <a href="/branding/images/phoneme/content/phoneme_feature_guide.pdf">

<h2><a name="cldc5" id="cldc5">Q: What's the difference between phoneME Feature 
      MR1 software and Sun's commercial product (CLDC HotSpot Implementation 1.1.3 
      and Sun Java Wireless Client 1.1.3)? </a></h2>
    <p> A: Sun’s commercial products (CLDC HotSpot Implementation 1.1.3 and Sun 
      Java Wireless Client 1.1.3) are built from the phoneME Feature MR1 code 
      base. There are some components included in the commercial code base that 
      are not available to the open source community due to licensing restrictions. 
      The licensing terms associated with Sun’s commercial product differ from 
      those of the open source software. The phoneME Feature software is licensed 
      under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">the GNU Public License, 
      version 2</a>.Sun’s commercial products are licensed under a Sun license.

    <p> A: Features and capabilities in future releases of phoneME Feature software 
      will be determined based on market need and will be openly discussed and 
      debated in the community. Final decisions on what gets incorporated into 
      the code base will be determined by the Project Owner or PMC (as appropriate).

    <h2><a name="cdc1" id="cdc1">Q: What is phoneME Advanced MR1 software?</a></h2>
    <p> A: phoneME Advanced is a development effort to enable an open source implementation 
      of the Java ME platform addressing the technical needs of devices in the 
      advanced phone segment of the market. The phoneME Advanced software is built 
      around Java ME Connected Device Configuration (CDC) and incorporates implementations 
      of a variety of key wireless industry standards. phoneME Advanced MR1 software 
      represents the first milestone release of phoneME Advanced software in open 
      source.

<h2><a name="cdc2" id="cdc2">Q: Will phoneME Advanced software be backwards-compatible 
      with the Java technology implementation on existing phones?</a></h2>
    <p> A: The goal of the phoneME Advanced software is to ensure that the application 
      model used predominantly across today's mobile devices, Mobile Information 
      Device Profile (MIDP), is available and fully supported on advanced mobile 
      phones. In addition, the phoneME project strives to deliver MIDP application 
      compatibility across devices running either phoneME Advanced or phoneME 
      Feature software.

<h2><a name="cdc3" id="cdc3">Q: I'm already using CLDC today, what more does phoneME 
      Advanced software offer?</a></h2>
    <p> A: The CDC architecture is well suited to leverage key high-level OS features 
      such as memory management, process structure, linking, multi-tasking, etc. 
      In addition to providing enhanced compatibility to and from implementations 
      of Java SE technology, the architecture is highly portable and reduces the 
      integration effort associated with a variety of application environments 
      and middleware components.

      and x86-based Linux devices. For a list of currently supported target hardware 
      and software platforms, see the phoneME Advanced <a href="https://phoneme.dev.java.net/content/phoneme_advanced_guide.html">Getting
