<h3>phoneME Open Source Project Vision</h3>

<p>Java Platform, Mobile Edition  (Java ME platform)  is the prevailing technology in the  mobile industry, with 1.2 billion mobile handsets deployed.</p>

<p>Downloadable applications and end-to-end solutions have fueled a robust economy for all the participants in the mobile value chain. Tools and resources to support the development and deployment of these devices have evolved rapidly along with the core technologies. Today, Java ME technology is used by more application developers than any other single technology in the mobile space.</p>
<p>The ubiquity and widespread deployment of Java ME technology has created unparalleled opportunities for advancing the platform. With community participation and the free flow of ideas and code, we have an opportunity to advance the platform to a new level of sophistication, robustness, and quality  for the devices of tomorrow. Java ME technology is essential for accelerating the deployment of rich multimedia applications and web services on all future mobile devices.</p>
<h3>Java Technology and Mobile Handsets</h3>

<p>The phoneME open source project will provide a centralized forum for collaboration on Java ME platform technologies, with the intent of rapidly advancing the platform for the next generation of applications and services. Toward that end, there are several key areas of innovation, as follows. 
<p>
</p><strong>Making Java ME Technology a First Class Citizen on Mobile Devices</strong>

<p>The goal of the community  goal is to make Java ME technology the underlying technology for more and more key applications on a mobile device. We would like Java ME technology to be used not just for games, but also for implementing more of the user experience on the device, spanning the range from phone applications such as address books and messaging, all the way to running the phone user interface.</p>
<p>This goal implies several technologies that the Java ME platform has pioneered and should be advanced through community efforts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accessing phone functions <br>
  With the increased prominence of Java ME technology on the phone comes the ability to access phone capabilities from a Java ME platform context. Location API's, messaging, Bluetooth, PIM functionality, and graphics acceleration are all examples of phone features that have been standardized in the Java ME platform. 
  The community should continue the trend for new API's and abstractions to allow access to phone functionality while it promotes  porting existing API's to an ever-expanding set of devices, widening the reach of Java ME technology.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Multitasking<br>
  Java ME technology has established 
      the necessary facilities and client infrastructure to 
      allow for multiple Java ME applications to  run 
      concurrently. This technology spans the range from low-end 
      devices with very limited hardware and OS support, all the 
      way to more capable devices with process-oriented 
      operating systems. Community participation should exploit and advance this technology to allow an 
      ever richer user experience. 
      Multitasking should become a way to seamlessly 
      integrate native device user experience with Java ME 
      technology, allowing Java ME applications to run alongside 
  native applications with uniform   look and feel. </li><br>

  <li>Robustness<br>
      As more capable, concurrent Java ME applications are written,  consumers 
      expect  reliability and robustness -- the desire for a crash proof environment. To that end, the community intends to 
      advance the state of the art in Java ME technology for inter-application isolation, reliable termination of 
      untrusted code and resource management. These technologies all contribute to a robust, 24x7 environment of concurrent 
      Java ME applications, giving developers increased confidence in the expanded use of Java ME on mobile devices.

      </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Responsive start-up and execution<br>
  The desire to integrate with a native environment and to give Java ME technology a prominent role on a mobile device emphasize the importance 
  an application's fast start-up and responsive execution. Community participation allows us to ever improve the performance of Java ME platform virtual machines and 
  libraries in this area, including new JIT compiler optimizations, OS integration, and use of hardware 
  acceleration. There are also opportunities for increased inter-application memory and resource sharing. Responsive 
  execution increases developer confidence  and expands the reach of Java ME technology on more devices.
  </li>
</ul>
    </p>

<strong>Integrating with Web 2.0 Technologies and Declarative UI</strong>
<p>The past few years have seen dramatic advances in Web technologies. 
  Markup-oriented UI description has become more prevalent and 
  capable, enabling a rich and compelling look. Scripting has 
  become widespread as a way to glue UI logic together and to 
  allow rapid application development. Web services have 
  become prevalent and easier to use; mashups integrate services for the creation of higher-level 
  applications.</p>
<p>The integration of rich markup-based UI, scripting, and web service access has resulted in compelling web-oriented content, commonly referred to as Web 2.0 technologies. With its ever-present deployment on more than a billion devices, its wide developer base, and its ever-evolving access to platform features,  the Java programming language offers  a unique way of taking advantage of these technologies. </p>
<p>Community participation, encompassing several areas of work, can provide the infrastructure to allow this integration to proceed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web rendering <br>
    This involves establishing modes of interaction between web content and the Java programming language, 
    defining how web content can invoke Java APIs and how 
    Java virtual machines can render web content. Included in this work is 
    an effort to provide lightweight rendering technology for 
    web content, spanning the range from XHTML and CSS to SVG. 
    When this vision is realized, it will be possible to 
    incorporate web content seamlessly inside a Java
    application. This includes the implementation of an 
    ECMAScript engine inside a Java virtual machine, sharing infrastructure
    between the two.    </li><br>
  <li>Separation of UI from application logic<br>

  Web 
    content is compelling because it establishes a healthy 
    separation between application logic and application UI. 
    The separation allows application UI to be replaced while 
    retaining application logic. It also allows different 
    developer communities to come together to create rich 
    applications. Graphics and interaction designers can put 
    together compelling content, programmers can use Java ME technology to write application logic, and tooling conventions bring the products of these communities together. Community participation can make possible these integrated<br>
    applications incorporating Java ME and web technology.</li>
	<br>
  <li>Libraries for easy use of web services<br>
  The past few 
    years have seen an explosion in the number of web services from  providers such as eBay, Amazon, Google, and Yahoo. In addition, the use of services such as 
    deli.cio.us and Flickr have enabled individuals to produce compelling content and share it on the web. Lightweight Java ME technology libraries could allow developers easy access to web services for getting and publishing information without the need to master the plethora of XML-based technologies and 
    their resource-intensive implementations commonly used on 
    larger systems. The Java ME platform's local processing 
    capability, access to permanent storage, and phone 
    functions make it ideal for creating compelling applications 
    incorporating web services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Improving Platform Consistency and Compatibility</strong></p>

<p>Key factors in the continued success of Java ME technology are consistency and compatibility across platform implementations. Developing applications and content in today's heterogeneous marketplace is a challenge. Developers 
  need a predictable and cohesive platform to rapidly and effectively create and deploy interesting 
  new content.</p>
<p>Driving such a consistent platform is significantly fostered by enabling 
  and encouraging all stakeholders in the industry to come together as a community 
  with a common vision. By collaborating on all parts of the technology, including 
  the platform software, tools, applications, and content, the community will 
  ensure the platform continues to evolve to meet the needs of all parties. 
  The goal is that this compelling cycle of innovation and collaboration will 
  lead to industry-wide adoption of a common implementation, thereby 
  making the Java ME platform and ecosystem more valuable for everybody.</p>
  
<p><strong>Bridging CDC- and CLDC-Based Technologies</strong></p>

<p>The past few years have seen the development of several Java ME technologies at a 
  breakneck pace. The community should establish the infrastructure and 
  architecture to allow applications written to these technologies 
  to co-exist and run in a uniform way. An example of this 
  diversity is the use of Java ME CLDC technology that forms the 
  basis for the MIDP profile, and the use of Java ME CDC 
  technology, with each presenting different approaches to key 
  platform features.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make the platform uniform<br>
    We intend to clarify and explain differences between CDC- and CLDC-oriented approaches to Java ME technology. We also intend to establish the architecture, best practices, and knowledge base to allow libraries to be written to run both in a CDC and a CLDC context.</li>

  <br>
  <li>Container architecture for abstraction <br>
  We are developing and would like to enhance technology to allow 
    current and future application models to run concurrently 
    on any given device. Our container technology abstracts 
    application model differences in lifecycle, security, and 
    runtime expectations. It prepares the Java    ME platform for execution of backwards-compatible technologies alongside new, cutting edge technologies in a 
    uniform fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you find our vision for the Java ME mobile platform exciting and will join us in creating the most innovative and widely-deployed application platform on the planet. &szlig;Get involved - share your ideas, ask questions, write code. What are the future applications that you want to enable for mobile devices? To which devices would you like to port Java ME technology? What new features would you like to add to the platform?
